# Ligustrum phenology
Study about the phenology of an invasive species that became a problem at Araucaria Forest, an endangered area in Brazil.

It also comprises the analysis of the environmental variables related to the found phenology pattern and a comparison among the invasive species and two native areas, one located in an urban area and the other in the countryside.   

Study Description

The study was based on the monthly observation of 49 trees of Ligustrum lucidum (Oleaceae) in the city of Curitiba, Paran√°, South Brazil. On each observation, the ocurrence of vegetative and reproductive phenophases was observed. Leaf flush, flower budding, flowering, unripe fruits and ripe fruits were the phenophases observed. The intensity of each phenological event for each individual was scored on a scale from 0 to 4, which represents the percentage of crown coverage (from 0 to 100%). The scores were used to calculate the Fournier Index, which estimates the intensity of each phenophase during an observation from the sum of the scores for each individual during that observation. 

Circular statistical analysis was used to test if the phenophases of L. lucidum exhibited a seasonal pattern. The mean angle (which corresponds to the central trend of each phenophase), circular standard deviation and the length of vector r, were calculated for each phenophase. The length of the vector r represents the concentration of data around the mean angle, and it varies from 0 (uniformly distributed around the year) to 1 (concentrated around the mean angle). The Rayleight test (z) was used to determine the significance of the mean angle for each phenophase.
