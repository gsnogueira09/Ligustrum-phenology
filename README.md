# Ligustrum phenology
Study about the phenology of an invasive species that became a problem at Araucaria Forest, an endangered area in Brazil.

It also comprises the analysis of the environmental variables related to the found phenology pattern and a comparison among the invasive species and two native areas, one located in an urban area and the other in the countryside.   



The study was based on the monthly observation of 49 trees of Ligustrum lucidum (Oleaceae) in the city of Curitiba, Paraná, South Brazil. On each observation, the ocurrence of vegetative and reproductive phenophases was observed. Leaf flush, flower budding, flowering, unripe fruits and ripe fruits were the phenophases observed. The intensity of each phenological event for each individual was scored on a scale from 0 to 4, which represents the percentage of crown coverage (from 0 to 100%). The scores were used to calculate the Fournier Index, which estimates the intensity of each phenophase during an observation from the sum of the scores for each individual during that observation.

Important notes:
* The table "phenophases.txt" show the frequencies of each phenophase through the year. It is used just for Circular analyses.
* The tables "leaf_flushing.txt", "flower_budding.txt", "flowering.txt", "unripe_fruits.txt" and "ripe_fruits.txt" show the frequencies of the intensity of each phenophase thought the year. These tables are meant to create the graphs.

Summary
  - tables to be used in the scripts (.txt extension)
  - script with the Circular analyses and graphs (phenology_Exp.R)
  - graphs of each phenophase (.pdf extension with the names of the phenophases)
